  <p>
    Applications to Harvard University for its incoming freshman class dropped to its lowest level in four years while other Ivy League schools said they received record applicant pools.
  </p>
 
  <p>
    Harvard said Thursday it received 54,008 undergraduate applications for the class of 2028. The previous year, the university had nearly 57,000 applicants, and for the two years before that, about 61,000 applicants and almost 58,000 applications, respectively. 
  </p>
<p>
  The 5% drop in total applicants was preceded by a 17% drop in early-admissions applications to Harvard. It is unclear why applications fell, but the decrease comes in a year when Harvard has faced turmoil after Hamas attacked Israel in October, its president resigned and the Supreme Court restricted how colleges can consider race in admissions.
</p>
<p>
  Discord over the Israel-Hamas war split the Cambridge, Mass., campus as tensions grew between pro-Palestinian and Jewish students. Students at Harvard and other universities protested over the war, and leaders grappled with how to respond. 
</p>

  <p>
  Harvard, among other universities, has been dealing with concerns of rising antisemitism on campus. The school’s former President Claudine Gay resigned in January after facing plagiarism allegations and charges that she did not respond with enough urgency to antisemitism at the university.
  </p>

  <p>
    A House committee led by a Republican congresswoman is investigating Harvard’s response to antisemitism. The investigation is ongoing, and the committee is also probing other schools, including Rutgers University and the University of California, Berkeley. Some Harvard donors and alumni board have said they are unhappy with the school’s work to protect Jewish students from harassment.
  </p>

<p>
  After the Supreme Court’s affirmative-action decision involving Harvard, some high-school students expressed confusion over applying to some schools. This is the first admissions season after the Supreme Court decision.
</p>

  <p>
  Confidence in higher education overall has shown signs of falling.

<p>
  Still, other Ivy League schools said their application pools were growing. The University of Pennsylvania and Yale University said they received the most applications in their history, with more than 65,000 and about 57,000 applicants, respectively. Dartmouth College reported almost 32,000 applications, which it said was a record. Applications to Columbia University rose to around 60,000 from about 57,000 the year prior.
</p>
<p>
  One other Ivy League college also reported a drop in applications: Brown University said it received nearly 49,000, down from about 51,000 the year before. 
</p>
  
<p>
  Harvard’s admission rate for the class of 2028 was about 3.6%, its highest rate in three years, according to data the school released. It admitted 1,937 students, the lowest figure in at least a decade.
</p>
  
<p>
  Applications to Harvard peaked two years ago, according to the school. The university has had more than 50,000 applicants for each of the last three years. Between 2014 and 2020, Harvard’s highest number of applicants stood at 43,330 in 2019.
