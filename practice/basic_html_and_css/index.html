          <h1>Parkinson’s Disease Can Now Be Detected Through the Skin</h1>

          <h2>New test identifies Parkinson’s by a protein rather than waiting for symptoms that can take years to appear</h2>

          <p>Debi Lucas had a tremor in her arm. Her feet froze when she tried to walk and she fell into her coffee table, busting her lip. </p>

           <p> She went to a neurologist who thought she had Parkinson’s disease. Doctors normally diagnose the neurodegenerative condition by symptoms. Lucas, 59, had them. </p>
            
            <p>But the neurologist, Dr. Jason Crowell, couldn’t be sure. The symptoms might be related to a traumatic brain injury Lucas suffered in a car accident decades earlier, he thought. Or they might be from her medications. </p>
            
            <p>To find an answer, Crowell turned to a new test: a skin biopsy that can detect an abnormal protein people with Parkinson’s have inside their nerves. He took samples of skin near her ankle, knee and shoulder and sent them to a lab. </p>
            
            <p>The results confirmed that Lucas has Parkinson’s. The diagnosis was scary, but Lucas finally knew what was causing her symptoms. “I was glad to have a name on it,” she said. </p>
            
            <p>The test sped her diagnosis, said Crowell, a movement-disorders neurologist at the Norton Neuroscience Institute in Louisville, Ky. “It just gives me more confidence,” he said. </p>
            
            <p>The skin test is an important part of progress researchers are making against Parkinson’s, the second-most common age-related neurodegenerative condition, which is on the rise and a major driver of disability, dementia and death. The test Lucas received, made by CND Life Sciences, a medical technology company in Scottsdale, Ariz., is one of a few in use or development to allow doctors to diagnose Parkinson’s based on biology rather than symptoms that can take years to appear.</p>
