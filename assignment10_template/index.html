        <h1>The Syracuse City School District Hopes to Improve ELA Proficiency Scores</h1>

      <p>In 2002, President Bush passed the "No Child Left Behind Act" requiring all 50 states to issue annual standardized tests to all students across the county. Since the beginning, there were debates over whether these tests were worth the time of both students and teachers. Some educators argue it's a test where everyone must answer the same set of questions creating a baseline for subject proficiency, but students disagree. </p>

      <p>Looking within New York State, ELA tests are administered to students in grade 3-8.  They often cause a lot of stress and anxiety for students who must sit for hours for the exams. On the other side of the spectrum, teachers find themselves teaching to the test rather than offering projects and other materials. Over the last several years, the state of New York hasn't seen much of an improvement since the tests were first implemented. </p>

      <p>Specifically within Central New York, the Syracuse City School District is looking to improve their scores from last year's statewide ELA test. The district has a history of extremely low proficiency rates. According to New York state data, less than 20% of students enrolled in 3rd-8th grade are proficient in English Language Arts.</p>

        <p>Jane Murphy, a curriculum coordinator for a tutoring program, says she notices the challenges students are facing. "Given their socioeconomic background, many of them are taking care of their siblings, helping work at family businesses...they're given a lot of responsibility at a very young age," Murphy says.</p>

        <p>However, some responsibilities students are faced with cuts into their academic experience. "We are told to come in never expecting an education level or reading comprehension ability of a student above the grade of fifth grade," Murphy explains.</p>

        <p>Murphy doesn't blame the students. "I think it's a reflection of how the district focuses its resources. There are tradeoffs of how you use funding. Do you use it to supply these students with two meals a day? Or do you invest in reading aids? The schools within the district face immense tradeoffs due to lack of resourcing."</p>

        <p>At the end of the day, the scores of these tests determine the attractiveness of the district for families. Elizabeth Wimer, a parent in the district, says she decided to educate her children privately. "It is because of the testing requirements and the way that their teachers would teach to the test that we choose to put them in private schools," Wimer says.</p>

</p>
        <p>Although her children are educated privately, Wimer still prides herself on contributing to the district. "We choose to live in the city because our taxes go to the Syracuse City School District, even though we then educate our children privately."</p>

        <p>Wimer's mindset tends to be the consensus among a lot of parents in the area. If parents can afford to put their children through private education, they will. The Syracuse City School District is one of the most impoverished communities in the country which reflects the poor proficiency rates compared to other districts in the state of New York. </p>

        <p>Looking at the graphic to the right, many of the surrounding districts have much higher rates of proficiency. That's due in part to the cost of living. It's much more expensive to live in a suburb of Syracuse than within the city lines. </p>

        <p>Living in a more expensive town allows for more tax dollars to go to the educational systems. In turn, they're able to hire better teachers, buy more textbooks, and offer more experiential learning opportunities for students. </p>

        <p>The New York State ELA exams took place on April 11-12, but the results have not been published yet. </p>
